## 📚 What I Learned

- **Difference between main, container, and section →**  
  **_main →_** Covers the most important content of the page. For browsers and accessibility tools, it means “this is the main content.”  
  **_container →_** A wrapper class used to center, align, and organize content, making layouts more controlled.  
  **_section →_** Defines thematic subsections (h1-h6, p) within the main content; usually used with a heading.

- **Difference between figure and figcaption →**  
  **_figure:_** Used to wrap independent content such as images, tables, or diagrams.  
  **_figcaption:_** Provides the description of the visual inside the figure, semantically linking the image with its caption.

- **Difference between min-content, max-content, and fit-content →**  
  **_min-content:_** Shrinks the content to the smallest possible size (words without line breaks).  
  **_max-content:_** Expands the content to the maximum width it can occupy without overflowing.  
  **_fit-content:_** The content stretches up to the defined limit, and if it exceeds, it is constrained.

- **margin: 0 auto; →** Horizontally centers the box itself.

- **text-align: center; →** Centers the text and inline elements inside a box.

- **line-height →** A property that adjusts the vertical spacing between lines of text. It improves readability by preventing lines from being too tight or too far apart.

- **display: block; →** The element takes up the full width of its container, and subsequent elements start on a new line.  
  Example block elements: div, p, h1-h6, section, article, main, etc.

- **cite →** A semantic tag used to denote the titles of books, articles, movies, music, or other works of art.  
  Browsers display it in italics by default, but unlike the `<i>` tag, it is not just for visual purposes; it explicitly marks the text as a work title.
